# [WIP] category-theory-exercises
Working through the lectures at https://www.youtube.com/user/DrBartosz in Lua.

## Running Tests
I'm using `busted` which is a simple unit test framework. I may add a script to run all the tests eventually, but for now:
```
lua_modules/bin/busted spec/<spec>.lua
```

## Style
I'm generally trying to follow https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/lua-style-guide.
